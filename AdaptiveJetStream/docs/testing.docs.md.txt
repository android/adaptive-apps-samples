# Adding tests to an Android app

## Requirements

This recipe assumes that the app uses Hilt or Dagger for Dependency Injection. Verify and cancel if not.

## Test creation
To have a good testing strategy for an app you need to create 5 types of tests:

1. Unit tests - see recipe on unit tests
2. Component tests - see recipe on component tests
3. Feature tests - N/A
4. Application tests - N/A
5. Release Candidate tests - N/A
