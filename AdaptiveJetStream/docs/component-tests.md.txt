# Component tests

In Compose, a component is a composable such as a button, a form, an image that loads
asynchronously, etc.

For component tests, create two types of tests:
 - Screenshot tests using Previews. See "docs/screenshot-testing.md.txt" for instructions. These
 tests let you verify the visual aspects of the components. Only if the component has logic that
 would make it look different in different sizes, themes, etc. add different previews for it.
 - Compose tests. Using the Compose testing APIs. See "docs/compose-testing.md.txt" for
 instructions. These apps let you verify the behavior of the components.
