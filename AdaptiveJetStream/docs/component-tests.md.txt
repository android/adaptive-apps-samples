# Component tests

In Compose, a component is a composable such as a button, a form, an image that loads asynchonously, etc.

For component tests, create two types of tests:
 - Screenshot tests using Previews. See "Setting up the Compose Preview Screenshot Testing plugin" for instructions
 - Compose tests. Using the Compose testing APIs. See "Test your Compose layout" for instructions.
